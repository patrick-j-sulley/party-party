Party Party is an random cocktail generator web app that takes user input of their name and a cocktail ingredient, and in turn, generates them a random cocktail with that ingridient in it. Party Party uses [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) external API.

Party Party was developed with a stack of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, Node.JS, and Express.
